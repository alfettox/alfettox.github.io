# Giovanni's Portfolio

Hi, I'm Giovanni!

I am an experienced Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend technologies and DevOps. My background in architecture, project management, and computer science enables me to design innovative and well-structured projects, as well as create and deploy apps on cloud architectures. I have successfully completed numerous projects during my studies at McGill University, as a freelancer, and with Wiley Edge Academy. I am always eager to learn more and enhance my skills to provide the best possible solutions. Please feel free to contact me for inquiries and information. Let's collaborate!
When I'm not coding, I enjoy various activities such as going to the gym 🏋️, hiking 🍁, and reading.
